## Project Structure

- `src/` – Core source code for graph search, models, plotting, and utilities.  
- `sims/` – Example scripts and data for running case studies and experiments.  
- `README.md` – Project documentation and usage instructions.  
- `universe.jl` – Main universe setup script.  

## How to run the optimization
The scripts compareGS.jl and wgt_dijkstra.jl within the sims folder can be used to run the code in case studies of interest.   
The scripts contain the code to define a case study (moons to consider, resonances and so on) and then the function calls to use to perform graph search.  
Examples of post processing are also added.
All the needed code is within the src folder. 

## Dependencies
The code relies on the following list of Julia packets:

JSMDInterfaces.Errors  
CairoMakie  
ColorSchemes
